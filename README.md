rcptstatmilter
==============

rcptstatmilter is anti-spam milter

rcptstatmilter keeps statistics about tries of sending mail for every sender
IPv4-address. If statistics is too bad, rcptstatmilter will forbid further
email until enough amount of good tries.

I recommend you to run it with "-l" flag for learning, before running without
"-l".
